#This is my MergeSort implementation

NOTE: I used GeeksForGeeks Mergesort as a guide and to help understand how the algorithm works


How to run:
  
 	To run this code call the Makefile, then run a.out executable.


What is MergeSort:

	MergeSort is a very popular sorting algorithm that puts an array of number in ascending order through a divide and   conquer method. 
	The algorithm basically works by splitting up the array into subarrays until it reaches arrays of size 1. 
	Then it continually takes those arrays and compares them and then joins them together. 
	it continues this process until the array is joined back together.


Performance:


		The Worst Case Performance of Merge Sort is: O(NLogN)
                The Best  Case Performance of Merge Sort is: O(NLogN)
                The Average is Also : O(NlogN) 

Why MergeSort over QuickSort?

               Since MergeSort is on Average Better than Quicksort, it provides  a safer bet. It is typically better in large data sets stored on external devices.
